# Hello there, I'm Omega

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a deep interest in systems programming, game development, and low-level software engineering. I enjoy working close to the metal — whether it's building DLLs in C++ or optimizing entropy calculations.


## Skills

- Learning: C++, Rust, Unreal Engine 5
- Interests: Systems programming, physics simulation, game engines, memory optimization
- Tools: Visual Studio, .NET Runtime 8.0, Git, GitHub, Discord.js


## Projects

### Shannon Entropy String Generator
- A hybrid C# + C++ application.
- The C# front-end generates random strings and sends them to a C++ DLL for Shannon entropy calculation.
- Aimed at exploring interop between managed and unmanaged code.

### Basic File Downloader (.NET 8.0)
- A simple Windows Forms-based file downloader using C# and .NET Runtime 8.0.
- Accepts a download link, file name, and storage path.
- Displays download speed, ETA, and status in real-time.
- Features:
  - Async file download with progress tracking
  - Clean UI for ease of use
  - Built with performance and minimalism in mind


### Alpha – Discord Moderation Bot
- Built using discord.js.
- Features include: moderation tools, command handling, and message logging.
- The bot can be found [here](https://github.com/Omega493/Alpha).

## Community Experience

- Moderator on a Discord server with over 8000 members.  
- Assist in event planning, bug testing, and development discussions.
- Collaborate with the bot developer as one of the programmers on the team.
